<h2>Brewery Supply and Demand</h2>
<p>According to the data available through the <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/fred.html">Economic Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St.Â Louis</a>, the total inventory of beer has grown fairly linearly over the last 20+ years. The sales of beer has grown as well, but not matching the inventory quite exactly.</p>
<p>In the chart below, notice the seasonality in the sales of beer as each year, especially<br />
that the months of January and February dip greatly from the peak months of November and December. Starting about 2007 you can also see that inventory starts growing faster than sales, which corresponds to beginning of the rise of craft and micro breweries popping up accross the country.</p>

<h3>What is a Price Index?</h3>
<p><strong>From the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ppi/data.htmhttp://www.bls.gov/ppi/data.htm">Bureau Of Labor Statistics</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Producer Price Index (PPI) program measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The prices included in the PPI are from the first commercial transaction for many products and some services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The data on price indices shows PPI for several different goods produced by breweries. A PPI always has an initial date at which the index began. This index date is usually when the agency recording began collecting data and is set to 100 for each of the categories below. The index date for each category below is June 1, 1982.</p>

<h2>Data Science Approach</h2>
<p><strong>Get data</strong></p>

<li>Build and test various models to predict ratings, sentiment, and consumption location, including multiple models by style and location</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Present and polish</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Visualize models in a Shiny dashboard for breweries to use</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data for the charts above came from the <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/fred.html">Economic Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St.Â Louis</a></strong></p>
<p><em>FREDÂ® stands for Federal Reserve Economic Data. FREDÂ® contains frequently updated US macro and regional economic time series at annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily frequencies. FREDÂ® aggregates economic data from a variety of sources- most of which are US government agencies. The economic time series in FREDÂ® contain observation or measurement periods associated with data values. For instance, the US unemployment rate for the month of January, 1990 was 5.4 percent and for the month of January, 2000 was 4.0 percent.</em></p>
<p>We used the FRED API to extract data on the supply and sales of beer over a 20 year period, as well as price indices for breweries.</p>
